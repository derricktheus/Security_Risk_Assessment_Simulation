# Security Risk Assessment Simulation

I conducted a mock security risk assessment for a fictional healthcare company using the NIST 800-53 framework. I focused on access control, authentication, vulnerability management, and patching. I documented risks in a lightweight register and mapped each one to the right control family.

**Contents**
- `risk_assessment_report.md` — my narrative of findings and actions
- `nist_controls_risk_register.xlsx` — risk-to-control register with likelihood, impact, owner, status

## Future Improvements
- Add risk heat map
- Automate scoring with a script


## Objectives
- Identify risks and score likelihood/impact
- Map mitigations to NIST 800-53 controls
